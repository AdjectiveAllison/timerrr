## ðŸ’½ Development

Run the following command to run the application:

    go run github.com/techygrrrl/timerrr/main

## âœ… Testing

Run the tests with the following command:

    go test -v ./...

To run tests with coverage run:

    go test -v ./... -cover

Write any operating-specific tests in a file for that operating system, e.g. `os_utils_linux_test.go` will only run on Linux.
